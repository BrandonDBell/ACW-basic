        <h1>About us
        </h1>
        <p>
            Aluminum Coatings West was created in 2015 with the sole purpose of servicing the aluminum conversion coating space within the 
        automotive industry.  The goal is to service the industry with expedient turn around times and high
         quality services from coating, subassembly and shipping to the customer. 
        </p>
        <h3>The Coating Process
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Coating process begins by immersing the work in a series of solutions where various operations are performed.
         The solutions are held in open top tanks and the work passes through each tank. The work usually consists of 
        specific items that are placed on special designed racks and carried through the process in batches.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overhead cranes move the racks from one tank to the next. ACW's facilities have multiple overhead cranes 
        to increase productivity and minimize "down-time." The work is rinsed thoroughly after each operation
         to avoid contamination and quality.
